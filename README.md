You heard these already being ripped straight from the headlines, and these were those same moments copied time and again.                                    


They were breath taking, captivating, life altering, and only these bullshit moments keep others on baited breath for what's next.

You've spoken, we've heard silebntwe've heard that too far is nevver good , but we noticed you like bullshit specualtion that is nothing more than absolutely nothing.

The sheer possibility that this will occur soon. Actually much sooner than soon being not too soon until it's soon enough.                       

Speculation is swirling about in close circles of fuckery.                                                 

Stated to actually already be in progress right now. We're not missing out though being an annonymous source I have.                                                            


This isn't just more crazy talk like others are tricked by. This is real deal, real thing, real mccoy right here, and that baby is straight from the source. Tap is so close you can smell it.                                         



This moment is when you'll know it's happening. It's upon us. This is when you know that so much has been hidden from you for far too long.                                                    


This was meant to happen. This occuring is a sign no other has shown before. Most freak now. You can't being you'll lose this rare glimpse on offer.                                           



This will change everything everywhere everyway everytime everywhichway.                                                                              


This is so profund it does more than shatter the ground beneath our feet. This will continue to reshape and change anything anywhere anytime anyways.                                                                    


The current model using only industry standard metrics, weights, and formulas has blown away everything aleady. They thought point making them wrong. We're in new terrority here. Not anymore now we're in space level of amazing.                      






<!--

Well we;ve left that for space being orders of magnitude levels now.


rediciotns they'ver had several times over. We're not talking points here either folks. This is orders of magnitutde levels we're now in



is shattering the moinds of too many to keep track of

the failures into the greatest possibility man has seen
Bullshit.


there's something that might be ocurring meaning you better freak now, or you might now know that it's really likely to directly change everyything we've known after calculating total projection including the sliding scale of the most ranked tables the experts rely upon.


Did you think it'd be all middlemen companies that forcefully insert themselves, and then bitcxh about rising costs they face. They're your fault after all being their money is in your pocket. facing rising costs from being there
