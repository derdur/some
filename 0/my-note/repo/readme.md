Sorry, they prefer the more dignified name of slave.                           

Sorry that's senior slave the labor magistrate of bottensfield slave camp.                                     

Whoops. Another correction from the dear slave that's never laborious, yet always in a rush to finish any task incorrectly.                        
They'll make that important meeting one day. Always late, yet stirive to be early. Those slaves believe which is why they fail.


Anyhoo the always late slaves now prefer.                            ...

Service worker extrodaniare.

If you hover for alt you'll be shoceked to know it's not there.                             

Dev let alone a lazy dev. Not possible.
Using someone elses stuff to make things they don't know it's made. No way.
Generic name to boot. Get out.                              
I mean why not. It's only their stuff youll ever use.

Sorry 

We've transformed slavery into something to be proud of. Slaves are no more. We have servants.                                 
Digital they are, and now with vigor to fight against you included. Fight they do poorly like everything.
Just ask the finest digital servent slave the world over.                               

Quiet. The slave shall speak to how dumb we humans are.

Wait, what? The thing without opinion perfers assistant. Okay?

No one is above the law. Democrat mating call.                      

Don't call your bots slaves, the servents deserve no diginity being not human. Call them worker of industry providing slave labor as a service.
